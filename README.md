##  DYNAMIC WEATHER DASHBOARD WEB APPLICATION ##
1.Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city in the world.
It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and displays it in a clean, user-friendly dashboard.
The app also dynamically changes its background based on the weather (e.g., rainy, cloudy, sunny) for a more interactive experience.

2.Problem Statement

People often need quick access to real-time weather details for any city worldwide. Manually visiting weather websites or apps can be time-consuming and inconvenient.
There is a need for a simple, fast, and user-friendly dashboard where users can just type a city name and instantly get the current weather.

3.Solution

This project provides a Weather Dashboard Web App that fetches live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Users can search any city, view its weather conditions, and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
The dashboard is built with a responsive design, clear visuals, and interactive features for a better experience.

4.Prediction Parameters

The dashboard displays the following real-time weather parameters:

- 🌡️ Temperature (°C / °F)

- 🤔 Feels Like Temperature

- 🌦️ Condition / Description (e.g., cloudy, rainy, sunny)

- 💧 Humidity (%)

- 🌬️ Wind Speed (m/s)

- 🌅 Sunrise (local time)

- 🌇 Sunset (local time)

- 🌍 Location (City, Country)

- 🖼️ Weather Icon (dynamic image from API)

- 🎨 Dynamic Background (changes with weather conditions)

- ⚡ Future enhancements can include:

*5-day Forecast with temperature trends*

- Air Quality Index (AQI).

- Chance of Rain (%).

- UV Index.

- Pressure and Visibility details.
